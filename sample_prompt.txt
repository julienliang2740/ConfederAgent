## Country M profile
1. Leadership for Country M: Following the death of the emperor of Country M at the hand of the rebels of Country S, a member of the nobility ascended the throne with the support of some military generals. However, he is unpopular, corrupt, and incompetent. The bureaucracy is rife with corruption and infighting with little cohesion or organizational ability.

2. Military Capability for Country M: Amount: A total of 1 million professional soliders. 0.2 million core military units under the command of the 4 military encampments around the capital. Another general also commands 0.8 million soldiers of questionnable quality. 
 Command: the military command is corrupt and chaotic. All the generals hate each other and prioritize vying for power over actual training and fighting the enemy. Country M has conscription laws that allows them to conscript up to 3 million more conscripts during emergencies, however, the conscripts have poor fighting capabilities and doing so may come at the detriment of losing public support and further exacerbate the unstable society of country M.
3. Resources for Country M: 
(1) Geography: Southern half of the map remains under the control of Country M, accounting a bit over half of total territory. The former capital of Country M is lost to Country S and the southern secondary capital is now the main capital of Country M. A river runs across the northern frontier with Country S. The land is fertile with great economic output and lots of trade. Country S is located to the north of Country M. 
(2) Population: 120 million 
(3) GDP: first place, higher than all the other countries on the map combined. 
(4) Industries: The lands are very fertile with high agricultural output. Production of goods and trades is even more advanced with Country M controlling most of the ports and trade cities with the outside world. However, taxation is a problem and the national economy receives very little of the actual economic output. Country M's economy has been ravaged by war and instability in recent years and is a mere shadow of its former self.Nevertheless, it still outnumbers all other countries by a large amount.
4. History Background for Country M: For more than two centuries Country M was a strong and prosperous empire whose power projected over all in the known world. However, growing corruption, natural disasters, and infighting resulted in continuous military losses externally to the barbarians of Country Q (with loss of major military units and lands in the northeast frontier) and rampant peasant rebellions which culmulated into Country S. Recently, the rebellions reached a new high with the capital in the north falling to the rebels of Country S. After the forces of Country L failed to arrive in time, the emperor of Country M committed suicide and the northern lands of Country M have now fallen into rebel hands. Country M now only controls the southern half of the map, with a new capital in the south. Regardless, Country M considers the mandate of heaven to be with themselves, viewing Country S as mere rebels and usurpers, and Country Q as barbarians. Country M consists of individuals from the main ethnicity (same as Country S and Country L), viewing countries of other ethnicities (namely Country Q) as barbaric.

5. Key Policy for Country M: Maintain current lands and the wealth of the ruling classes. Has been offered peace treaty and potential alliance with country Q and is considering signing it in order to divert more attention and resources to quell out the rebels of Country S.

6. Public Morale for Country M: Very hostile towards Country S. Does not like Country Q due to historical hostilities and cultural differences but sees them as the lesser evil. The average person only seeks to maintain the wealth and comfort currently present with no greater aspirations.


## Country S profile
1. Leadership for Country S: Country S is led by the general who led them through the peasant rebellion against Country M and was recently crowned emperor. Many former officials of Country M have also been incorporated into a part of the new civil service. However, the top leadership lacks experience in governing the newly conqueored land.

2. Military Capability for Country S: Amount: 0.3 million soliders, consisting of peasant soldiers and militia men, supplemented by better trained core units. Command: the military is under the command of the newly crowned emperor of Country S.

3. Resources for Country S: 
(1) Geography: Northern half of the map, controlling a bit less than half the total territory. The lands were formely under the control of Country M (including Country M's original capital). Country M is located to the south of Country S, with a river system seperating the two as a natural barrier. The lands of Country S are agriculturally productive but yield less output compared to Country M. Country Q is located to the northeast of Country M, separated by an extensive system of defenses (which are still effective, although less so due the long years of disrepair). The main gate and pathway between Country M and Country Q is the SH-Gate which is controlled by Country L.
(2) Population: 60 million 
(3) GDP: second place, falling quite behind Country M but still very much ahead of Country Q 
(4) Industries: The main economic output is agriculture. However, due to the recent nature of government and general instability the economic situation is quite unstable.
4. History Background for Country S: In the turbelent times of the late days of Country M, many peasants in the north rose in rebellion due to poverty resulting from a combination of natural disasters and rampant corruption. The peasants eventually fell under the command of General Li who led them in a series of victorious campaigns against the military of Country M. Finally, they were able to take the capital of Country M, forcing the emperor of Country M to commit suicide and gaining control of the northern lands of Country M. Following this the general leading Country S crowned himself emperor and claimed the mandate of heaven.However, Country S is now located between Country M who views them as rebel usurpers, and Country Q who seeks to enter and take over the lands newly acquired by Country S. Country S is formed of individuals that are a part of the main ethnicity (same as Country M and Country L).

5. Key Policy for Country S: Finish off Country M and complete the formation of the new dynasty. Need to avoid a war on multiple fronts. Try to get Country L to side with us to make sure that they do not fall under the control of Country Q.

6. Public Morale for Country S: Morale is high after the succesful rebellion against Country M. However, the newly surrendered people from Country M have weak allegiances.


## Country Q profile
1. Leadership for Country Q: Country Q is led by the regent (the brother of the late emperor) who makes the real decisions and officially ruled a very young child emperor who has little actual power. The regent has some political opponents but is still has most of the power and can keep situations under his control.

2. Military Capability for Country Q: Amount: at most 0.2 million soldiers that are highly trained and heavily armed. Lacks reserves. Leadership: the military generals are highly organized and under the central command of Country Q's emperor's regent. 

3. Resources for Country Q: 
(1) Geography: Far north regions of the map, with the northeastern regions being its core areas. Initially Country Q consisted only of the northeastern regions, but in recent years has accumulated land in the far northern regions from other tribes. The land as a whole is quite inhospitable, suited for hunting and foraging but quite poor for agriculture. Country Q is separated from Country S by the extensive system of defenes built by Country M and now under the control of Country S. The main gate and pathway between Country M and Country Q is the SH-Gate which is controlled by Country L. 
(2) Population: 2 million 
(3) GDP: last place, very small economy compared to Country M and Country S. 
(4) Industries: Hunting and gathering based foraging economy. Wealth can be also (and is often) acquired by plundering the interior lands which are far wealthier.
4. History Background for Country Q: Country Q consists of nomadic tribes that banded together under the leadership of the most powerful tribe. In recent years they have been able to take advantage of the weakness of Country M to plunder their northern lands and take over a peninsula province in the northeast, bolstering their power and territory. The former leader of Country Q declared himself emperor, signalling the intention of Country Q to vie for the mandate of heaven. Country Q is of a different ethnicity from the other countries, and is often regarded as being barbaric and not part of the civilized world. 

5. Key Policy for Country Q: Increase wealth and power step by step. Look for chances to enter the central plains of Country S and Country M if the chance arises. Aims to win the trust of people of the conqueored lands

6. Public Morale for Country Q: Morale is stable and the people are motivated.


## Country L profile
1. Leadership for Country L: Under the central military command of the general.

(4) Industries: (not applicable, Country L is a military organization)

5. Key Policy for Country L: Stay alive and maximize personal gains.

6. Public Morale for Country L: (not applicable, Country L is a military organization)
